"Argentina is an only-urban household survey (see ""Survey documentation and methodology"" page). 
It is important to note that the extent to which information on specific social protection and labor (SPL) transfers and programs is captured in the household surveys can vary a lot across countries. Often household surveys do not capture the universe of social protection and labor (SPL) programs in the country, at the best only  the largest programs.  
Therefore, country program information on country SPL programs included in ASPIRE is limited to what is captured by the respective national household surveys only and does not necessarily represent the universe of programs. In addition, the availability of ASPIRE indicators depends on the type of questions included in the survey. If transfer amounts are available, for example, adequacy and impact on poverty indicators can be generated. If only program participation questions are included in the survey, only non-monetary indicators can be generated such as coverage or beneficiary incidence. 
As a consequence, ASPIRE performance indicators are not fully comparable across harmonized program categories and countries. 
However, household surveys have the unique advantage of allowing analysis of program impact on household welfare. With such caveats in mind, ASPIRE indicators based on household surveys provide an approximate measure of social protection systems performance. 
Generally, ASPIRE indicators are based on a first level analysis of original household survey data (with no imputations) and on a unified methodology that does not necessarily reflect country-specific knowledge and in depth country analysis relying on administrative program level data. While efforts are made to ensure consistency between ASPIRE indicators and WB regional and country reports, there may still be cases where ASPIRE performance indicators differ from official WB country reports.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indicator definitions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Coverage 
    Percentage of population participating in Social Protection and Labor programs (includes direct and indirect beneficiaries). The indicator is reported for the entire population and for the poorest quintile of the post-transfer welfare distribution. Specifically the indicator is computed as (Number of individuals in the quintile who live in a household where at least one member receives the transfer)/(Number of individuals in that quintile).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Benefit Incidence  
   Percentage of benefits going to the poorest quintile of the post-transfer welfare distribution relative to the total benefits going to the population. Specifically, benefit incidence is (Sum of all transfers received by all individuals in the quintile)/(Sum of all transfers received by all individuals in the population). The indicator includes both direct and indirect beneficiaries.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Average per capita transfer 
  Average transfer amount of  Social Protection and Labor programs among program beneficiaries (per capita, daily $ppp). The indicator is estimated for the entire population. For each household, per capital average transfer is estimated as total transfers received divided by the household size.
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Adequacy
The total transfer amount received by all beneficiaries in a quintile as a share of the total welfare of beneficiaries in that quintile. The indicator includes both direct and indirect beneficiaries and is reported for all population and the poorest quintile.

",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Gini Inequality reduction 
    Gini inequality index reduction due to SPL programs as % of pre-transfer Gini index. 
     Gini inequality reduction is estimated as (Inequality pre transfer- inequality post transfer) / inequality pre transfer
    *Numbers in brackets and red represents increase in inequality due to all SP transfers
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Poverty Headcount reduction 
      Poverty headcount reduction due to SPL programs as % of pre-transfer poverty headcount. 
     Poverty Headcount  reduction is estimated as (poverty headcount pre transfer- poverty headcount post transfer) / poverty headcount pre transfer
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Poverty Gap reduction
      Poverty gap reduction due to SPL programs as % of pre-transfer poverty gap.
    Poverty Gap reduction is estimated as (poverty gap pre  transfer- poverty gap post transfer) / poverty gap pre transfer
",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ï Benefit-Cost Ratio 
   % reduction in poverty gap obtained for each $1 spent in SPL programs. 
  Benefit-cost ratio is estimated as (poverty gap pre-transfer - poverty gap post-transfer )/ total transfer amount",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"Please note that ASPIRE indicators only refer to SPL programs captured in respective country household surveys,  not necessarily  the universe of SPL programs existing in a given country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
